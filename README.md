# 1. Introduction and Problem
Over the past year, as the pandemic disrupted supply chains and caused shortages in critical auto components, resulting in a lack of new vehicles, which caused the used car price surging. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™ Consumer Price Index, used car prices are up a staggering 39.8% since March of 2020, while the U.S. inflation is only up 6.3%. JPMorgan analysts say prices will continue to rise and will stay high for longer than expected. It is difficult for people to use previous data and experience to judge whether the price of a used car is a good deal. So, this project tried to create a method to determine whether the price of a used car is appropriate.
